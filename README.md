<h1>OpenVAS Vulnerability Management</h1>





<h2>Description</h2>
<b>This lab is focused on cybersecurity vulnerability management. There are quite a few steps involved but this is a general overview. My blog will be more "step by step" and I plan to create a YouTube video to do this lab justice.

I set up a Vulnerability Management Scanner server and installed OpenVAS within the Azure marketplace. Upon logging in via SSH through PowerShell OpenVAS begins to deploy and provides default credentials to the Greenbone web app. I then created a VM with the intention of being vulnerable. I accomplished this by installing outdated versions of Adobe Reader, Firefox, and VLC. The goal is to run credentialed and non-credentialed scans and compare results. Once all vulnerabilities are detected, we will remediate the system by uninstalling the applications.

<h2>Languages Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell:</b> Use SSH to remote into the OpenVAS VM 

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>OpenVAS:</b> Scanner component of Greenbone Vulnerability Management

<h2>Non-credentialed scan results. Notice it does not detect the out-of-date vulnerable software installed.</h2>

<h2>Credentialed scan results. The credentialed scan displayed over three times the amount of results. Remediated the vulnerabilities and rebooted the VM. </h2>
